                Hello, my name is Robert Bolstad. I'm a 26-year-old Norwegian with a background as an electrician. I'm currently in bergen studying Front end development at Noroff school of technology and digital media.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Hobbies
            </h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy going fishing, reading, hiking or working on side projects. I'm currently looking into game development as making a game is something I always wanted to do.
            </p>
            <h3>
                More on my background
            </h3>
            <p>
                I'm originally from a small town just outside bergen but decided to move to the city when I was 19 to get closer work at the time. I used to work as an electrical trainee for a large company called Oneco AS, which specialises in industrial electrical work and automation. During my time as a trainee, I mostly worked on the same construction project which was building this new school called "western university of applied science". My time working as an electrical trainee was fun, but I also started questioning whether this is something I want to do for the rest of my life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After I got my degree as an electrician, I started working as an electrician for a different company. At the time, it was tough to find a job, so I had to travel to a different city to work. I ended up working for this company for six months until my contract expired.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once my contract expired, I had to move back home and find a new job. At this time, I started working for a food factory where I did several tasks unrelated to my degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this time, I started to look at alternative ways to make money during my free time. One thing I came across something called affiliate marketing which is when you promote a product and receive a small percentage on everything you sell. To do this, I made several websites using WordPress to promote the products. Writing a product review wasn't something I enjoyed doing, and I didn't make that much money either.  I did, however, really enjoy making the websites as this was the highlight of every project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Later I decided to go back to school to study coding as this was something that had peak my interest while making WordPress websites. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019 I went back to school and enrolled in a program called Front end development at Noroff school of technology and digital media.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've enjoyed my studied so far. I've learned a lot, like how to make simple websites using HTML, CSS and javascript. I can only get better from this point, and I'm looking forward to future projects I might undertake.
